The outlook web app service is a mail service provided by Microsoft. A researcher named Max discovered a Copy and Paste XSS vulnerability in the web service in 2021.

However, I was able to bypass that patch using the `<template>` tag. Yea this was a simple Sanitizer bypass where I could inject an `<iframe>`, `<script>` tag.
